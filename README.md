## List Comprehension
List Comprehension List comprehension offers a shorter syntax when you want to create a new list based on the values of an existing list.
Example:
Based on a list of groceries, you want a new list, containing only the groceries with the letter "e" in the name.
Without list comprehension you will have to write a for statement with a conditional test inside:
## For Loop
for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).
## Break Statement
The break statement in Python terminates the current loop and resumes execution at the next statement

The break statement can be used in both while and for loops
## Continue Statement
The continue statement in Python returns the control to the beginning of the while loop

The continue statement rejects all the remaining statements in the current iteration of the loop and moves the control back to the top of the loop

The continue statement can be used in both while and for loops
## Pass Statement
The pass statement is used as a placeholder for future code.

When the pass statement is executed, nothing happens, but the avoid getting an error when empty code is not allowed.

Pass statement is used when it's not yet implemented, and keeps the program running.
## Else after While
Else is only executed when a while condition becomes false

## Syntax Errors
Syntax errors or often called parsing errors.

Syntax errors occur when Python can't understand what you're commanding. Whereas exceptions (errors while operating) occur when Python understands what you are commanding but gets problems following what you command (occurs when the application is already running).

## Exceptions
if a statement or expression is syntactically correct, it may cause an error when an attempt is made to execute it. Errors detected during execution are called exceptions and are not unconditionally fatal
